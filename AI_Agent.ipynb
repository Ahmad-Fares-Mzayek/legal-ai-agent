            "    *   **Labor Law:** The name of this document.\n",
            "    *   **Minister/Ministry:** Refers to the Minister/Ministry of Labor.\n",
            "    *   **Employer:** Includes both natural persons (individuals) and corporations hiring workers for wages. This includes government entities (Article 5).\n",
            "    *   **Worker:** Any individual working for an employer, receiving a wage, even if not directly supervised in all cases.\n",
            "    *   **Work Contract:** Covers the employer's commitment and the worker's acceptance to perform work for a wage. Applies to various categories including civil servants, charities, agriculture (under certain conditions), and even qualification/training contracts (Article 5).\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **General Provisions:**\n",
            "    *   **Fundamental Right:** Work is considered a right for all citizens (Article 3), though non-nationals can work provided other conditions of the law are met (Article 5.1).\n",
            "    *   **Shari'ah Compliance:** Provisions must adhere to Islamic principles (Article 4).\n",
            "    *   **Scope:** Applies broadly, including specific provisions for drivers, agricultural workers, part-time workers, and government employees (Article 5.2).\n",
            "    *   **Nullity:** Any work contract clause contradicting this law is void (Article 8). Settlement agreements for worker rights triggered by the law must be at least as beneficial as legal provisions, unless more favorable.\n",
            "    *   **Language:** Arabic is the primary language for contracts, records, etc., but Arabic text prevails if a foreign language is used alongside it (Article 9).\n",

Minimum wage rules are generally governed by this, especially the concept of 'Basic Wage'.\n",

            "    *   **Domestic Workers:** The Ministry is drafting separate regulations for them (Article 7.2).\n",
            "    *   **Sea Workers:** Some workers on ships under 500 tons are exempt from certain provisions (Article 7.3).\n",
            "    *   **Seasonal/Temporary Workers:** Covered by basic provisions but not by some specific worker benefits like continuous service increments (Article 6).\n",
